How to get the sources?
=======================

Upstream doesn't want to tag release : he runs the scripts, obtains unicode-*
packages, commits them and gives them versions.

So to get something useful, we take a git commit and use it to generate the
package ; with the following modifications:
- remove .git/
- remove data/ (which means we have our own resources.js)
- remove tests/ (they basically ship prebuilt data to make a comparison)
